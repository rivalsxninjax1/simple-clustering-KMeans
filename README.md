# Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform customer segmentation using the KMeans clustering algorithm on a real-life dataset. The dataset, `customers.csv`, contains customer details such as `CustomerID`, `Age`, `AnnualIncome`, and `SpendingScore`. This example focuses on clustering customers based on their annual income and spending score.

## Files
- `customers.csv`: A CSV file containing customer data.
- `clustering.py`: A Python script that reads the CSV data, performs clustering using KMeans, and visualizes the results.
- `README.md`: This file that describes the project and provides instructions.

## How to Run

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3.x
   - Packages: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`

   Install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## . How to Use the Example

1. **Prepare Your Environment:**  
   Make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn).

2. **Save the Files:**  
   - Create a file called `customers.csv` and paste the CSV content provided above.
   - Create a file called `clustering.py` and paste the Python code provided.
   - Create a file called `README.md` and paste the README content.

3. **Run the Script:**  
   Open your terminal, navigate to the directory containing these files, and execute the script using:
   ```bash
   python clustering.py
# simple-clustering-KMeans
